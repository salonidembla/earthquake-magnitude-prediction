# earthquake-magnitude-prediction
This project presents a comparative machine learning-based approach to predict earthquake magnitudes using seismic attributes from the STEAD (Stanford Earthquake Dataset). By applying ensemble models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, we aim to identify which algorithm provides the most reliable predictions.

Key Features:
 Utilizes real-world earthquake data from STEAD (2015 onward)
 Performs in-depth data cleaning, filtering, and outlier removal
 Handles missing values and irrelevant seismic attributes
 Compares performance of 4 powerful ensemble models
 Includes data visualizations like 3D scatter plots, world maps, and correlation heatmaps
 Random Forest achieved the best performance (MSE: 0.1386, RÂ²: 0.7844)
