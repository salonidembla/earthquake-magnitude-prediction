# earthquake-magnitude-prediction
This project presents a comparative machine learning-based approach to predict earthquake magnitudes using seismic attributes from the STEAD (Stanford Earthquake Dataset). By applying ensemble models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, we aim to identify which algorithm provides the most reliable predictions.
