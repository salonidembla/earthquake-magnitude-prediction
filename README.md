Earthquake Magnitude Prediction
This project presents a comparative machine learning-based approach to predict earthquake magnitudes using seismic attributes from the STEAD (Stanford Earthquake Dataset). By applying ensemble models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, we aim to identify which algorithm provides the most reliable predictions.

Key Features
Utilizes real-world earthquake data from STEAD (2015 onward)

Performs in-depth data cleaning, filtering, and outlier removal

Handles missing values and irrelevant seismic attributes

Compares the performance of four powerful ensemble models

Includes data visualizations such as 3D scatter plots, world maps, and correlation heatmaps

Random Forest achieved the best performance

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.1386

R² Score: 0.7844
